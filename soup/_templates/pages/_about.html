<h2>About This Site</h2>

<p><a href="/">Whatsoupisittoday.com</a> is a rudimentary website which attempts to make a vague guess as to what soups might be available in several popular outlets on a given day.</p>

<p>The site was built and is maintained by <a href="http://pointbeing.net/">Simon Harris</a>, but credit for many of the ideas involved must go to Vedat, Ciaran, Kirstie, Dan and Sara. Blame for the appalling visual design remains squarely with Simon.</p>

<p>All code is written in Python and runs on the <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django framework</a>.</p>

<h3>FAQ</h3>

<dl>
	<dt>Why is the site sometimes wrong?</dt>
	<dd><p>Data concerning what soup it actually is today come from a variety of sources, but typically the listings are read from the outlets' websites. It isn't rare for the information on those sites to differ from reality, in which case there's very little we can do about it.</p>
	<p>Think of the additional element of surprise as a small, bonus nugget of lunch-related excitement.</p></dd>
	<dt>Can you add my favourite shop/my own shop?</dt>
	<dd><p>It's certainly possible. Get in touch and we'll see.</p></dd>
	<dt>How can I get in touch?</dt>
	<dd><p>You can send comments and questions to soup at pointbeing dot net.</p></dd>
